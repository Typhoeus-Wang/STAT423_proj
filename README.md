author: Qirui Wang, Yujia Dai

- Dataset:
	- Clarify: What do you mean by "Are external tools useful in phishing URL classification?"?
	* Dataset split to train & test, ratio 9:1

- Exploratory Data Analysis
	* Predictor Variables Distribution (box plot & histogram)
	* For each predictor variables, analyze descriptive statistics (min, max, mean)
	* Missing values

- Methodology:
	* Use Full Model, multicollinearity -> remove some variables hopefully
	* Model Selection: 
		* Reasoning about CP & AIC
		* Use CP, AIC to select model (backward & forward)
			* if the selected models are the same, we just 
	- Model Interpretation:
		* Confidence Interval
		* Significant parameters
		* Goodness of fit
			* Residual plots
			* QQ plot needed? (Office hour)
- Model Evaluation
	* Run on test dataset
	* ROC curve
	* Put result to table
- Conclusion 
	* Use result to answer research questions

- Limitation and Future Work
  	* Limitation and action item
